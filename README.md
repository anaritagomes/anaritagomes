### Hi there üëã


I am a Software Engineer with 10 YOE in several industries and academic environments. 

I love Python and Data, although I have worked with a broader stack (Java, Ruby, HTML, CSS, Javascript).

I know my ways around SQL, NoSQL, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Polars, GIT, CI/CD, Docker, JIRA and Agile.

You'll probably find this Github not so populated, because my main contributions are privately held.
